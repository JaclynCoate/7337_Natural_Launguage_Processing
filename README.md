# MSDS 7337 Natural Launguage Processing
## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to share my work in order to complete the Masters of Science in Data Science 7337 Natural Language Processing course for Southern Methodist University. The Glossary folder is an ongoing assignment in the class to tracked newly learned terms in my work. Additionally, I've provided a folder containgin the semester's homework assignments and my solutions for them.  Lastly, the data folder is a dump of raw data sets I work through the entire semester as an easy reference for my ipynb notebooks. This work was completed in ipynb documents using jupyter notebook/lab. 

## Github Case Study Structure
* [Homeworks] - Homework assignments completed across units for the semester.
* [NLPGlossary] - terms learned and documented throughout the semester.
* [Datasets] - semester data sets
